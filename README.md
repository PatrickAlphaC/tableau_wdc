# Alpha Vantage Tableau Web Data Connector

Hoping to give NYU students a little easier time using Tableau and Alpha Vantage data, I put together this so that things work!

Tableau has an older browser running in order for it to access the WDC's, so certain javascript doesn't work. You have to either use their debugger or test it on Tableau yourself :/
Web Data connector SDK information below

I'm a little newer to javascript and npm, but I think this is the basic gist.

To run start

`git clone https://github.com/PatrickAlphaVantage/tableau_wdc.git`

and then in that repo run

`npm start`

After that, you can open simulator on your localhost, and hit "Start interactive Phase" to test it out.
Have fun!
